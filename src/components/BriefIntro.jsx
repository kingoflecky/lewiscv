      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        I'm Lewis, a software engineer with experience across financial
        technologies and retail. My roles to date have been predominatly
        Front-End focussed, though I'm always keen to take on new challenges.
        I'm based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and am open to working remotely with
        companies globally.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside engineering, I built and run a successful UK-based marketing
        company, Pivotal | the visual media company. Find out more at{" "}
        <a>getpivotal.co.uk</a>. My creative portfolio lives at <a>lquinn.co.uk.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        I have a Bachelors degree with Honours in Politics, Philosophy, &
        Economics, which I obtained whilst working full-time.
