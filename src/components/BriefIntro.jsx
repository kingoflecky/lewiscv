      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
      I'm Lewis, a software engineer with experience across financial technologies and retail. My roles to date have been predominantly Front-End focussed, though I'm always keen to take on new challenges. I'm based in Edinburgh, Scotland, and am open to working remotely with companies globally.

      <p>
        Alongside engineering, I built and run a successful UK-based marketing
        company, Pivotal | the visual media company. Find out more at{" "}
