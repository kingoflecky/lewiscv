      <h3>My Education</h3>

      <h4>BA(Hons) Politics, Philosophy, & Economics</h4>
      <p>October 2020 - May 2024</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Identified a lesser-researched topic to independently research.
          Following this I produced a final honours project studying the
          intricate link between the effects of climate change in the Arctic and
          international security.
        </li>
        <li>
          Built great working relationships with faculty staff and peers alike.
          Used the opportunity to learn as much as possible, in turn really fine
          tuning my professional and academic skillsets.
        </li>
        <li>
          My degree is highly versatile. Practicing Economics developed skills
          in detailed data analysis and numeracy. Philosophy broadened my
          perspectives by helping me challenge the way that I think, the
          rationality of my arguments, and to consider the oppositions
          perspective. Politics then supports when gaining stakeholder buy-in. I
          always present my findings in a confident, well-structured manner.
        </li>
        <li>
          With in person tutorials or meetings rare, studying alongside working
          has required me to be extremely disciplined in maximising my
          efficiencies. This strengthened my planning and organisational skills.{" "}

      <h4>InfinityWorks Software Engineering Bootcamp (Front-End)</h4>
      <p>February 2022 - May 2022</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ahead of joining Sainsbury's Bank as an Associate Engineer, I
          successfully landed myself a place on a sponsored 12-week bootcamp
          focussed on preparing people without tech backgrounds for their first
          engineering role. I was one of 12 to successfully gain a place on the
          program from a UK-wide pool of over 1200 applicants.
        </li>
        <li>
          Main deliverable was an e-commerce site which used React & AWS. The
          customer had to be able to browse products, edit their basket, input
          personal details, and receive email confirmation of their order. The
          app used React State, Hooks, and API requests, to build an effective
          user-experience. I also handled design using Figma.
        </li>
        <li>
          Was at the forefront of building a support network and made lasting
          connections with peers and tutors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Learnt the fundamentals of how to be a great software engineer from a
          group of top engineers who became tutors.{" "}
